Ransomware encrypts data to make systems unusable until payment is demanded.
Safe recovery starts by restoring from known-clean backups, not the most recent backups.
Attackers often try to destroy or delete backups to prevent recovery.
Immutable backups reduce the chance that recovery points can be altered or wiped out.
Test restores are essential because a backup that cannot be restored is not a backup.
Use a clean recovery environment to reduce the risk of reinfection during restoration.
Before restoring, verify identity systems and credentials to avoid restoring into a compromised environment.
Network segmentation can limit lateral movement and reduce blast radius during an attack.
MFA and least-privilege access reduce the chance attackers can take over admin accounts.
Incident response should prioritize containment, then recovery, then verification before returning to production.
Communicate to leadership in plain language: impact, timeline, and the plan to restore safely.
If attackers exfiltrated data, recovery also includes legal, regulatory, and customer notification steps.
Recovery point selection matters: choose a restore point before the intrusion, not just before encryption.
Keep backup infrastructure isolated so attackers cannot easily reach it from production systems.
A recovery plan should include restore runbooks and periodic tabletop exercises.
