Lesson 1 — Why AI Gives Different Answers

Probabilistic behavior, not thinking

Lesson 2 — Tokens: What the Model Actually Sees

Tokenization, tokenizers, cost & limits

Lesson 3 — Context Windows: Why AI Forgets

What the model can see, rolling context, prompt degradation

Lesson 4 — Embeddings: Representing Meaning

Text → vectors, similarity, meaning vs knowledge

Lesson 5 — Similarity Search: Finding Relevant Information

Vector search, relevance, why keywords fail

Lesson 6 — Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Bringing the right context back

Lesson 7 — Attention: Relevance Inside Context

How the model weighs what it can see

Lesson 8 — Transformers: The Architecture Behind Modern AI

How attention, context, and scale come together

Lesson 9 — Generation Controls: Temperature, Top-p, etc.

Controlling variation without changing knowledge

Lesson 10 — Memory & State

Making systems persistent outside the model

Lesson 11 — Tools & Function Calling

Letting models act safely and deterministically

Lesson 12 — Safety, Guardrails & Prompt Injection

Why AI systems fail in adversarial ways

Lesson 13 — Prompt Design Patterns: Structuring Inputs for Reliability

Prompting as interface design, not magic

Lesson 14 — Agents

Orchestrating loops of context, memory, tools, and decisions

Lesson 15 — Model Selection & Tradeoffs

Choosing the right model for cost, latency, and reliability

Lesson 16 — Caching & Optimization

Making AI systems fast and affordable

Lesson 17 — Inference: Runtime Behavior, Cost, and Latency

What actually happens when you hit “send”

Lesson 18 — Deployment & Monitoring

Keeping AI systems healthy over time

Lesson 19 — Evaluation & Failure Modes

Hallucinations, drift, retrieval errors, tool misuse

Lesson 20 — Data Boundaries, Privacy & Trust

What should and should not go into an AI system

Lesson 21 — Agent Frameworks & Orchestration Libraries

LangChain, LlamaIndex, etc. — when and why

Lesson 22 — MCP & Tooling Standards

Standardizing how models connect to tools and systems

Lesson 23 — Capstone: Designing Real AI Systems

Architecture, tradeoffs, and when not to use AI
