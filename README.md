# 🤖 Learn AI with Me

👋 Hi There!  I'm Mike and as of writing this I know very little about AI - but that's about to change...I hope!

Backstory - After a solid year of going back and forth with ChatGPT I noticed that these LLMs were getting better, producing significantly more accurate content. It was at this point I figured I better learn how this is all working, as it's honestly, beginning to accomplish more and more things that I do on a daily basis, but faster, and most the time, better!

💡 This is where I realized I have no idea how this stuff works, no idea what is happening underneath the hood - and being such a complex topic, I honestly don't know if I ever will - but that isn't going to stop me from trying!

Which leads me to now and this series - This repository, once completed, will contain a from-scratch, hands-on learning series designed to help practitioners understand how modern AI systems work, not just how to call an API or simply prompt ChatGPT

The goal of this series is simple:

🎯 Go from “I know nothing about AI” → “I can confidently build and reason about an AI agent.”

Each lesson will build on the previous one, combining:

* 🧠 Plain-language explanations
* 🧩 Visual mental models
* 💻 Runnable code examples
* 🛠️ Practical exercises

No prior AI or ML background is required - which is obvious, because I have none - so let's learn this together!

## 📁 How This Repository is Organized

The repository is structured as one folder per lesson, in learning order.

```text
/
├── README.md
├── lesson-01-foundations/
├── lesson-02-models-and-prompts/
├── lesson-03-tokens-context-and-limits/
├── lesson-04-embeddings-and-search/
├── lesson-05-retrieval-and-rag/
├── lesson-06-tools-and-function-calling/
├── lesson-07-memory-and-state/
├── lesson-08-agents/
└── lesson-09-building-an-agent/
```

Each lesson is self-contained and will typically include:

```text
lesson-XX-lesson-name/
├── README.md          # 📘 Lesson explanation (theory + mental models)
├── examples/          # 💻 Runnable code samples
├── exercises/         # 🏋️ Optional hands-on challenges
├── diagrams/          # 🧭 Visuals used in the lesson
└── notes.md           # 📝 Extra context, gotchas, or references
```

Feel free to work through lessons sequentially, or jump to a specific topic if you already have some background.

## 📚 What This Series Covers

It's not all hammered out yet, but in my own aspirations, here's what I'd like to cover...

* 🧠 What large language models actually do (at a high level)
* 🔤 Tokens, context windows, and why they matter
* ✍️ Why prompts work (and why they fail)
* ❓ What the heck is temperature, inference, transformers, etc...
* 🧮 How embeddings enable semantic search
* 🔎 How Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) works
* 🔌 How tools and function calling extend models
* 🧠 What “memory” means in AI systems
* 🤖 How agents make decisions and take actions
* 🧱 How to assemble all of this into a working agent

## 🚀 How to Use This Repo

Recommended approach:

* ▶️ Start with Lesson 1
* 📖 Read the lesson README
* 💻 Run the examples locally
* 🧪 Modify the code and break things
* ➡️ Move on when the concepts feel intuitive

You don’t need to memorize anything — the focus is understanding why things behave the way they do.

## 🧰 Prerequisites

* 🧑‍💻 Basic familiarity with programming concepts
* 🔑 API access into an LLM - I'll be using OpenAI
* 🐍 Python installed (used in most examples)
* 🤔 Curiosity and willingness to experiment

Specific setup instructions (virtual environments, dependencies, API keys, etc.) are included inside each lesson folder.

## 👥 Who This Is For

This series is aimed at:

* ☁️ Cloud and platform engineers
* 🔧 DevOps and SREs
* 📣 Technical marketers and architects
* 👨‍💻 Developers new to AI
* 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Moms & Dads & Sons & Daughters and everything else
* 😤 Anyone tired of “just prompt it” explanations

If you’ve ever wondered how the model actually came up with that answer, you’re in the right place.

## 🤝 Contributing

This project is meant to be approachable, practical, and accurate. Contributions that help improve clarity and understanding are always welcome.

You don’t need to be an AI expert to contribute — in fact, some of the best contributions come from people learning this material for the first time.

### 💡 Ways to Contribute

Here are some great ways to help:

* ✏️ Correct errors or typos
Small fixes matter, especially in explanations and comments.
* 🧠 Add clarity or context
If something didn’t click for you at first, improving the explanation helps everyone.
* 🧩 Improve examples
Simplify code, add comments, or provide an alternative example that’s easier to reason about.
* 🧭 Add diagrams or visuals
Mental models are a big focus of this series. Visuals are always welcome.
* 📝 Expand lesson notes
Extra context, common pitfalls, or “things that confused me” notes are incredibly valuable.

### 🔁 How to Contribute

* 🍴 Fork the repository
* 🌱 Create a feature or fix branch
* ✏️ Make your changes
* 📬 Open a pull request with a short explanation of what you changed and why

If you’re unsure where something belongs, that’s okay — open a PR or issue and we’ll figure it out.

### 🧭 Contribution Guidelines

A few simple guidelines to keep things consistent:

* Keep explanations plain-language and practical
* Avoid unnecessary jargon where possible
* Prefer understanding over completeness
* Examples should favor clarity over cleverness
* If adding code, include comments explaining why, not just what

This is a learning-first repository, not a reference manual.

### 🗣️ Feedback & Discussion

If you spot something confusing but aren’t sure how to fix it:

* Open an issue
* Ask a question
* Suggest an improvement

Feedback from people actively working through the lessons is especially valuable.
